                        <p>“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.</p>
                        <p>“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.”</p>
                        <p>“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go first?”</p>
                        <p>“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”</p></section>
